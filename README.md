# Whack-a-jellyfish
Game using ARKit to smack random jellyfish around your room.
Lessons learnt - Using cocoapods framework called Each which sets up the timer in the application. Using ARKit, 3D modelling 
Using UITapGestureRecognizers, adding Nodes an positioning them. Using hit tests, Using CAAnimations and SCNTransactions.
Using textures and conversion from dae files into scn files. Also making use of a function that creates random numbers.

The users has 10 seconds to locate a jellyfish floating around and to hit it when another will appear randomly in the users
environment. There is no scoring involved but as I learn more about AR I will add scoring to my other games.
